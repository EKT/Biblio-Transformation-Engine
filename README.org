* Introduction

  The biblio transformation engine (BTE) is a java framework developed
  by the [[http://www.ekt.gr/][Hellenic National Documentation Centre (EKT)]] and consists of
  programmatic APIs for filtering and modifying records that are
  retrieved from various types of data sources (eg. databases, files,
  legacy data sources) as well as for outputing them in appropriate
  standards formats (eg. database files, txt, xml, Excel). The framework
  includes independent abstract modules that are executed separately,
  offering in many cases alternative choices to the user depending of
  the input data set, the transformation workflow that needs to be
  executed and the output format that needs to be generated.

  The biblio-transformation-engine is included in the core distribution
  of the DSpace digital repository platform since version 3.0 and forms
  the basis of the batch import feature of DSpace (i.e. importing
  records of various standards bibliographic formats into DSpace
  repositories).

  Version 0.9 is a major redesign of the library, that makes it easier
  for the user to add DataLoaders, Modifiers, Filters and
  OutputGenerators and offers greater control over the transformation
  process.

  If you need an older version, it can be found [[http://code.google.com/p/biblio-transformation-engine/][here]].

* How to use the library

  Biblio transformation engine uses the [[http://maven.apache.org/][apache maven]] tool for building
  and dependency resolution. The library is split in two modules:
  bte-core, that includes the basic infrastructure of the BTE, and
  bte-io that includes some DataLoaders and OutputGenerators.

** Getting the jar from the central maven repository

   Include in the dependencies section of the pom.xml of your project
   the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>gr.ekt.bte</groupId>
  <artifactId>bte-core</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.3.1</version>
</dependency>
#+END_SRC

   If you want to use some of the loaders or the generators in bte-io
   you will need to add the following as well:

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>gr.ekt.bte</groupId>
  <artifactId>bte-io</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.3.1</version>
</dependency>
#+END_SRC

** Building from source

   Clone this git repository, and use maven install to add bte in your
   local maven repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/EKT/Biblio-Transformation-Engine.git
cd Biblio-Transformation-Engine
mvn package
mvn install
#+END_SRC

   After that you can add the xml snippets mentioned above, in your
   project's pom.xml to make the library API available to your
   classes.

* Dependencies
  Most external dependencies come from the bte-io project. If you
  provide your own data loaders and output generators, you will not
  need them. In any case Maven handles the dependencies, so probably
  you will not need to concern yourself with them, but they are
  recorded here for reference.

  One notable exception is that you will need the Java environment
  1.6 or newer.
** BTE parent dependencies (inherited by child projects)
   - log4j version 1.2.17 (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)
   - junit version 4.11 (http://junit.org/)
   - dom4j version 1.6.1 (http://dom4j.sourceforge.net/)

** BTE io dependencies
   - opencsv version 2.3 (http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/)
   - google gson version 2.2.4 (https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
   - jbibtex version 1.0.8 (https://code.google.com/p/java-bibtex/)
   - oai4j version 0.6b1 (http://oai4j-client.sourceforge.net/)

* Changelog
  - version 0.9
    + Major redesign of the library. Check the documentation (still in
      progress) for more detailed info.

  - version 0.9.1
    + Added an Endnote data loader
    + Fixed DSpaceOutputGenerator bug: not producing empty .xml
      files if there are no data to write in them.

  - version 0.9.2
    + Added OAI-PMH dataloader
    + Added an XML namespace manager for use with XPathRecord (for the
      moment it is hardcoded for the oai_dc and dc namespaces returned
      from OAI requests).
    + Added the method getFields in the Record interface and
      implemented it in XPathRecord and MapRecord.
    + Fixed DSpaceOutputGenerator bug: Consecutive calls to
      writeOutput, do not overwrite previously written data anymore.

  - version 0.9.3
    + Add Excel data loader
    + Add MultiSource data loader
    + Automatically install sources and javadocs in the local
      repository when issuing mvn install
    + Bugfixes for OAI-PMH data loader

  - version 0.9.3.1
    + Fixed bug in OAIPMHDataLoader
