* Introduction
  The Biblio Transformation Engine (BTE) is a software framework,
  designed to convert data between different formats. It is being
  developed by the Hellenic National Documentation Centre
  (http://www.ekt.gr).

  An earlier version of this library (0.8 specificaly) has been
  integrated into DSpace (http://www.dspace.org), in order to
  facilitate the mass import of metadata records from various sources
  (Endnote, BibTex, RIS, TSV, CSV) into DSpace installations (see 
  [[https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=32481931][this page]] for more info).

  This document describes the version 0.9 of BTE, that differs
  significantly from its predecessors, in an effort to make it more
  modular and avoid the need for code duplication when extending the system.

** Concepts
   Each run of the BTE executes three distinct steps:

   1. Input loading
   2. Data transformation
   3. Output generation

   In the heart of BTE there is the concept of the /record/. Each
   record is considered to be a list of key-value pairs[fn:records].

   In the first step an input loader reads data from the data source
   and creates a set of records that are then passed on to the 

   The transformation process allows the use of /filters/ and
   /modifiers/, that affect respectively the contents of the /record
   set/ globally and each record individually.

** Design goals


[fn:records] A key can actually be associated with multiple values.
